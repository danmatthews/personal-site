>I saw a pretty common question from Tyris on the Laracast forums this morning about hiding the ID from the URL of their laravel application.

I've done this on a lot of projects, and figured i'd show how i approach the subject using the [Hashids library](https://github.com/ivanakimov/hashids.php).

## Install Hashids:

This part is simple, add it to your project with:

```
composer require hashids/hashids
```

## Create a provider to handle generating HashIDs automatically for your models.

(Psst...My way of adding event listeners is a little "old-school" now, you might want to upgrade to an observable class, or adding event listeners through the model)

```php
php artisan make:provider HashIdModelProvider
```

Then make sure you add this to your `providers` array in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
//
//
//

  \App\Providers\HashIdModelProvider::class
]
```


### Set up a column in your database.

In order to generate a HashId that's unique to the model we're creating it for, we need the model to have an `id` - these are assigned by the database, so we can only add a HashID *after* the model has been initially saved.

That means that the column that stores the HashID value will *not* have a value when saved initially, so it must be `nullable()`, for example:

```php
Schema::create('posts', function($table) {
    $table->increments('id');
    $table->string('url_string')->nullable(); // So it won't throw errors when saving posts.
    $table->text('post_content');
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

### Listen for the model created event.

When a new `post` is created, we want to *create* and *save* a HashID in the `url_string` column of the table!

So, add an event listener for the model `created` event in your service provider you created:

```php
use App\Post;

public function boot()
{
  Post::created(function($model) {
    // Create and save the hashid here.
  });
}
```

Now, all we have to do is create the actual HashID, assign it to the `url_string` column of the `model`, and that's it!

```php
use App\Post;
use Hashids\Hashids;

public function boot()
{
  Post::created(function($model) {
    $generator = new Hashids(Post::class, 10);
	$model->url_string = $generator->encode($model->id);
    $model->save();
  });
}
```

Notice how in the call to `new Hashids`, we're passing two arguments:

```php
new Hashids(Post::class, 10);
```

The first, is a string, which will be something like `\App\Post` - this acts as a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) of sorts, making sure that the hash it generates is unique to this class.

If you *didn't* pass this, then the `Post` with an ID of 1, and a `User` with an id of 1 may end up with the same hash!

The second argument is a *minimum length* - by default Hashids will spit out the shortest length string possible - usually one or two characters. We want at least 10 here to make it not look silly in a URL.

*(This minimum length stuff is totally optional but i prefer a longer hash by default)*

## Bonus round!

Do you use route model binding? that is, say you have a route:

```php
use App\Post;

// www.myapp.com/posts/24
Route::get('posts/{post}', function(Post $post) {
  // $post is a fully fledged App\Post instance thanks to model binding!
});
```

You can update Laravel's automatic resolution for model binding by importing the Route facade and adding this code to your service provider:

```php
use App\Post;
use Hashids\Hashids;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

public function boot()
{
  
	
// Your other code above here

Route::bind('post', function ($value) {
  return Post::where('url_string', $value)->first();
});

}
```

## Update: Bonus round two:

You can quickly set the column name that route model binding should use to search for by overriding the `getRouteKeyName()` method on your model:

```php
// Post.php

public function getRouteKeyName()
{
    return 'url_string';
}

```
